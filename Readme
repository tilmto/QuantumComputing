Qubit Allocation:

The codes in the directory Source simulate the process of qubit allocation:

QubitAllocationNew is the basic model which takes bridge transformation into consideration. 

QubitAllocationErrorModel builds the error model of ibmqx5.

QAX is the optimization of the bridge model.

Architecture is the comparison between different hardware architectures.  

The scripts in PythonScript are for extracting sequence from benchmark and analyzing the results.
